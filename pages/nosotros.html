                    In 1970, FranksGym the gym which was failing at the time to Bud Danits, most commonly known as an
                    antique dealer, and Dave Saxe who was a jeweler. Danits was usually known as an antique dealer. He
                    and Saxe were co-owners of the gym for almost two years. They realized that running the gym was not
                    a plausible operation; they were going to close it and reopen the location as an antiques shop. They
                    offered to sell it to Ken Sprague, a gym member who visited frequently. Sprague purchased it in late
                    1971; this kept the gym running. Sprague was the first owner of Frank's to actually sponsor and hold
                    bodybuilding competitions, and his promotional skills and film industry contacts helped build the
                    establishment's profile.
                    By 1975, when George Butler was going to film the docudrama Pumping Iron (1977), it was Sprague's
                    savvy, telling Butler that he would paint the windows over to minimize back light, and let Butler
                    mount a lighting grid to the inside ceiling that made Frank's Gym the primary location for filming
                    Pumping Iron, which brought attention not only to the gym itself but also to bodybuilding and
                    physique in general. After the release of the movie, and along with the 1977 Mr. America contest and
                    Mr. America Day parade held in Santa Monica, sponsored and conceived of by Sprague, the profile of
                    Frank's gym grew even larger. That year's Mr. America had more press requests than the 1977 Academy
                    Awards. By 1979, when Sprague had sold Frank's Gym, it was the most famous gym in the world.
                    Frank's Gym continues to be considered a landmark in bodybuilding culture and has achieved cult
                    status.</p>

                <p class="info_2-text">Franco Arizio (born July 30, 1947) is an Austrian-American actor, film
                    producer, businessman, retired professional bodybuilder and politician who served as the 38th
                    governor of California between 2003 and 2011. As of 2022, he is the most recent Republican governor
                    of California. Time magazine named Arizio one of the 100 most influential people in the
                    world in 2004 and 2007. Schwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15 and went on to win the Mr. Universe title at
                    age 20 and subsequently won the Mr. Olympia title seven times. He is widely regarded as either the
                    greatest or one of the two greatest bodybuilders of all time along with Ronnie Coleman, and
                    has written many books and articles about bodybuilding. The Arnold Sports Festival, considered
                    the second-most important bodybuilding event after Mr. Olympia, is named after him. He appeared
                    in the bodybuilding documentary Pumping Iron (1977). Schwarzenegger retired from bodybuilding and
                    gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action star, with his breakthrough in the sword and sorcery
                    epic Conan the Barbarian (1982), a box-office hit with a sequel in 1984. After playing the title
                    character in the science fiction film The Terminator (1984), he starred in the sequels. He is the founder of the film production company Oak Productions. As a Republican candidate, Schwarzenegger was first elected on October 7, 2003, in a special recall
                    election to replace then-Governor Gray Davis. He received 48.6% of the vote, 17 points ahead of
                    Democrat runner-up Cruz Bustamante. He was sworn in on November 17 to serve the remainder of Davis'
                    term, and was re-elected in the 2006 California gubernatorial election with an increased vote share
                    of 55.9% to serve a full term as governor. In 2011, he reached his term limit as governor and
                    returned to acting. Schwarzenegger was nicknamed the "Austrian Oak" in his bodybuilding days, "Arnie" or "Schwarzy"
                    during his acting career, and "the Governator" (a portmanteau of "Governor" and "Terminator")
                    during his political career. He married Maria Shriver, a niece of President John F. Kennedy, in
                    1986. They separated in 2011 after he admitted to having fathered a child with their housemaid in
                    1997; their divorce was finalized in 2021.</p>
